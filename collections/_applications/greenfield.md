Forestry Client Services' greenfield template. For testing and demonstration purposes.

The Greenfield-template is a node.js application built with nestJS, and the main purpose is to provide a GitHub Actions template to automate the process for testing, security scanning, code quality checking, image building and deploying for an application.

This project is in active development. Please visit our issues page to view or request features.

Currently, our most exciting offering is the GitHub Actions pipeline, which includes:

+ Pull Request-based ephemeral, sandboxed environments.
+ Docker(/Podman) container building.
+ Build caching to save time and bandwidth.
+ GitHub Container Registry image publishing.
+ RedHat OpenShift deployment, with other options under consideration.
+ OpenShift artifact pruning on PR completion.
+ SonarCloud continuous code quality and security scanning.
+ GitHub CodeQL semantic code analysis and vulerability scanning.
+ Snyk development, vulnerability and security scanning.
+ OWASP ZAP Zed Attack Proxy security scanning.
+ Jest JavaScript testing enforced in-pipeline.
+ ESLint linting enforced in-pipeline and on code staging.
+ TypeScript strong-typing for JavaScript.
